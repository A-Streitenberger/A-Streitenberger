### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

my name is Alex and I'm currently finishing my master degree in Computer Science at JGU in Mainz. I already have several years of experience as a working student in various companies, including large corporations and small start-ups. Since December 2023 I have been working as a freelancer programming API integrations in the logistics industry.


Here on GitHub you can find projects I'm working on and want to share.

**Project easyFastGP**: An implementation of a standard genetic programming in Python with implemented performance improvements, especially the evaluation of individuals in numba annotated functions.

**Project spring-user-management (will be published soon)**: A Spring Boot application for user management. This project will serve as a base project for others and will include the following features Single Sign-On (SSO), 2FA authentication, registration by email verification and other security measures (e.g. locking users out after X incorrect password attempts).
