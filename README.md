### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

my name is Alex and I'm currently finishing my master degree in Computer Science at JGU in Mainz. I already have several years of experience as a working student in various companies, including large corporations and small start-ups. Since December 2023 I have been working as a freelancer programming API integrations in the logistics industry.


Here on GitHub you can find projects I'm working on and want to share.

**Project easyFastGP**: An implementation of a standard genetic programming in Python with implemented performance improvements, especially the evaulation of individuals in C.

**Project user management (not yet published)**: A Spring Boot application for user administration. This project will serve as a base project for others and includes the following features: Single Sign-On (SSO), 2FA authentication, registration and email verification and other security measures via Spring Security.
